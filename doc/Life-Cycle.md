# The life cycle

This is currently a roadmap of the project that may eventually be converted
on a document to introduce the project to others.

## Phase 1: Planning

### Design principles

The life cycle of *iai* began, after the idea, on its [design principles].
They are meant to be a strong foundation to build *iai* upon them.

The self-discussion can be followed on [#1], it will be a work in progress
until the 1.0.0 release.

continues on defining its [goals].

The self-discussion can be followed on [#2], it will be a work in progress
until the 1.0.0 release.
