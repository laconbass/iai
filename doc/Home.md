## Philosophy behind the *iai* term

The name *iai* is taken from the japanesse martial art *iaido*. Under the
hood it has a deep philosophical meaning. *iaido* is the path of personal
reintegration, the fight against the ego to reach the purity of mind,
*The union of mental and physical entities to reach the harmony of the
spirit*.

The *iai* term comes from two ideograms. *i* means spirit and *ai* means
union, harmony. Together, *the spirit union* or *the spirit harmony*. The
word is short, symmetric, and easy to read. It's just beautiful, and
suggests quickness. This attribute built the slogan:

> **As fast as say "iai"**
