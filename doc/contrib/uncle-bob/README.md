# [Robert Cecil Martin] aka. *"Uncle Bob"*

I met with his work while researching specifically about [SOLID], and generally
about the principles of Object Oriented Design (OOD).

Every pdf file on this folder came from [this source], while researching about
the topics mentioned above, and is kept here for reference exclusively, without
intention to infringe copyright. If you are reading this and think something
should not be here, please contact me.

Big thanks to the *uncle Bob* for sharing his knowledge.
