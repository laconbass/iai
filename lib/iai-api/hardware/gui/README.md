# iai-api-gui module

This module is intended to interact with the native OS GUI. This feature
depends on the awesome [electron](url needed), software by the awesome
[github](url) people.

The *senseless* thing of controlling an electron process from a node process
has the intent of managing browser windows around the screens, to have a fine
grained control over the hardware enviroment. The applications iai produces are
web based, meant to work across the network, so not meant to be packaged with
electron.
