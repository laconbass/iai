# Notes about this directory

This directory stores the bash code **TO BE SOURCED**.

**Forgive _is-being-sourced_ tests** like ideas at:
- http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/299621/49721
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2683279/how-to-detect-if-a-script-is-being-sourced

At least, forgive that tests for a while. It adds complexity. **KISS please**.

- It's too early to succesfully stablish a project directory structure
- Avoid prematurity applies here.
- On the while, bash code meant to be `source`'d, goes here.
- Use a path resolver (like `iai dir` or so) to research paths to the source files.
- That way, at future, will be easier to re-arrange this directory and its contents.
