I met with her work while researching about practical applications of the
Single Responsibility Principle ([SRP]).

Every pdf file on this folder came from [this source], while researching
about the topics mentioned above, and is kept here for reference exclusively,
without intention to infringe copyright. If you are reading this and think
something should not be here, please contact me.

Big thanks to Rebecca for sharing his knowledge.
