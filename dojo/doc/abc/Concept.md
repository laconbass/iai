# The *iai* concept

The deep roots of the [whole project](Home) are described hereafter.

## Philosophy behind the *iai* term

The term *iai* is taken from the japanesse martial art *iaido*. Under the
hood it has a deep philosophical meaning. *iaido* is the path of personal
reintegration, the fight against the ego to reach the purity of mind,

> The union of mental and physical entities to reach the harmony of the spirit.

The *iai* term comes from two ideograms. *i* means spirit and *ai* means
union, harmony. Together, *the spirit union* or *the spirit harmony*. The
word is short, symmetric, and easy to read. It's just beautiful, and
suggests quickness. This attribute built the slogan:

> **As fast as say "iai"**

## A mental attitude

The *iai attitude* is known as a personal belief on the following statement:

That's *why iai is considered an attitude*, because it implies believing in
one's ability to improve oneself.
