# The decision procedure

[concept]: https://github.com/laconbass/iai/wiki/Concept

This *procedure* has one and only one goal: to put on practice the [concept].

## Taking decisions

Apart from *philosophy and excuses* (see below), the process is simple:

1. Observe and identify
2. Research and decide
3. Review and evolve (repeating 1, 2 and 3)

The key to maintain alive that cycle is to **lose the fear of making mistakes
while maintaining the ability to identify them**.

## The path of *continual improvement*

[continual improvement]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process
[kaizen]: https://github.com/laconbass/iai/issues/8

The decision process applied is always the same, based on - like the
*iai concept* - a [continual improvement] wish. Researching this field the
creator met with *[kaizen]*, a fact - being eye-opener or just coincidence -
that proves to be possible such [continual improvement] process:
**the fact that it is and has been applied with success**.

## About the *creator*

It's important to note the origin of every decision taken here. The creator
of this project is a self-taught programmer, with some experience and some
knowledge, but he isn't an academician of computer science. Every decision is
taken after researching the knowledge available out there but on them are
present his hyperactive mind, his perfectionism excess, his strengths and
weakness.

> The responsability of each critical decision within the *iai* project
> beginnings is mine. It's also my responsability identifying when that
> decisions are failures or successes.
