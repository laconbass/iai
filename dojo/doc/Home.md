## Abstract

[concept]: https://github.com/laconbass/iai/wiki/Concept
[decision procedure]: https://github.com/laconbass/iai/wiki/Decision-Procedure
[life cycle]: https://github.com/laconbass/iai/wiki/Life-Cycle

The whole project is based on a thoroughly defined [concept] and a simple but
powerful [decision procedure] to put it on practice. With that in mind,
the [life cycle] begins its infinite loop.
